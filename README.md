# Meat-type-prediction
• Objective: In this project, developed a classification model for different meat type using various deep learning techniques 
and evaluated the fittest model for given data. 
• Outcome: The transfer learning model using ResNet50 outperformed the custom CNN, demonstrating better 
generalization, faster convergence, and superior performance for the image classification task. 
• Key skills: Python , Deep learning( Transfer learning, Convolution Neural network),  Colab notebook, Libraries: pandas, 
google.colab, tensorflow, numpy, model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix.
